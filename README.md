This is a mobile e-commerce application for purchasing ladies bags.In this app, I have created a Login and Sign Up page for the user. A Product page is developed using Recycler View for displaying all the products from firebase along with few details and image. A Description page is created for displaying details of the product which is fed from firebase with dynamic functionality to increase and decrease the quantity of the product which also changes its price. A cart page is developed for displaying all the selected  items in recycler view having functionality to change the quantity of the products or delete the products and when user clicks on Check Out button, a form is displayed to fill the user’s address and card details. These fields are validated using Reg-Ex and once user places an order, the cart’s data is removed from the firebase and from the application.
